                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m glad you’ve stopped by. My journey has been shaped by
                    the belief that hard work and passion can change lives—not
                    just our own, but the lives of those around us. I’ve been
                    called a “resourceful rough neck,” with a knack for taking
                    on tough challenges and finding creative solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love exploring new ways to make an impact—whether that’s
                    helping folks achieve their goals or discovering fresh
                    perspectives in business and beyond. My consulting approach
                    draws on a blend of practical know-how and a genuine desire
                    to see others flourish.

            <section>
                <h2>My Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    Life is more than spreadsheets and deadlines; it’s about
                    finding meaning in what we do. For me, that means creating
                    an environment of curiosity and growth—where we dare to ask
                    big questions, dream creatively, and never shy away from
                    rolling up our sleeves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in a world where curiosity fuels our passions and
                    empathy shapes our work. Each conversation, project, or new
                    connection is another chance to brighten someone’s day or
                    spark a meaningful change.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Gentle Encouragement</h2>
                <p>
                    If there’s one thing I’ve learned on my path, it’s that we
                    all have the capacity to grow and explore—no matter where
                    we’re starting. Sometimes we just need a little nudge and a
                    supportive guide along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I encourage you to step into your own adventure: set bold
                    goals, chase big ideas, and keep an open mind to all the
                    possibilities this world has to offer.
                </p>

                <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re looking for hands-on guidance, a second
                    opinion, or simply someone to brainstorm with, I’m here to
                    help. Together, we can harness that sense of purpose and
                    discovery, turning visions into reality—one step at a time.
